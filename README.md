# 🎮 JavaFX Game UI

A visual showcase of the **in-game user interface** I developed as part of a university project.  
All assets were recolored and neutralized to comply with NDA restrictions — only the visual layout and interaction design are shown here.

## About This Project

This UI was part of a multiplayer board-game project built in a team environment.  
I was responsible for the **in-game interface (GameView)**, focusing on:
- Visual hierarchy and layout
- Event handling and turn updates
- Smooth user interactions (buttons, modals, dynamic data display)
- Integration of UI components with the backend game logic

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a **visual portfolio reference** to demonstrate my JavaFX front-end development skills.  
It does not contain executable source code or assets — only the UI presentation.
